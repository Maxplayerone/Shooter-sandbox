# THE GAME
The game is inspired by Dani's first ludum dare entry (game called Fair 'n square). My game howered puts
more emphasis on giving the user a lot more control. The user can access a console window, which gives
him an ability to change the game for example inreasing enemy spawn rate or changing player's color
